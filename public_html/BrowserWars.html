                    <p class="blog-post-meta">February 19, 2021</p>

                    <p>The internet that we know today was nothing like how it was in its early stages. This is not a
                        coincidence since the creation of the internet browser played a key role in the evolution of the
                        modern-day internet and is regularly used to access it today. Upon the invention of the world wide
                        web, it brought upon a war between multiple companies to become the most technologically advanced
                        and most profitable browser.</p>

                    <p>Among those companies was <strong>Microsoft</strong>, headed by Bill Gates. He had envisioned that
                        the average person
                        could have personal computers at home with his company’s Windows operating system. The business
                        model at the time was to make profit of customers who would pay to join the Microsoft network in
                        order to access information.</p>

                    <p>A war would start as a result of a major breakthrough from a company called <strong>Netscape</strong>
                        with its very
                        first product, Netscape Navigator, a multiplatform browser that a bunch of young computer
                        programmers had designed as a graphical web browser where the user could point and click,
                        making it much more user friendly.</p>

                    <p>With the help of rich and well-known entrepreneur and computer scientist, Jim Clark, and the
                        co-author of Mosaic, Marc Andreessen, Netscape was founded in 1994 under the initial name Mosaic
                        Communication Corporation, soon renamed as Netscape Communication Corporation in the same year.
                        It was the first company to attempt to capitalize on the world wide web. When it launched Netscape
                        Navigator, it was an instant success and was the most widely used web browser, causing its
                        competitor, Microsoft, to completely shift their focus on developing a web browser.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>According to Netscape, Microsoft would arrive at their doorsteps to give them a final condition. The
                        deal was probably 1 million dollars for its intellectual property or Microsoft would simply copy
                        their code and crush Netscape. Microsoft denies having made such an offer, but if proven true, it
                        was an illegal act of the antitrust law, which was put in place to prevent giant companies such as
                        Microsoft from becoming a monopoly of the industry. This would be the beginning of an antitrust
                        lawsuit against Microsoft, in which Microsoft was ultimately ruled against as guilty of committing
                        monopolization.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Meanwhile, although Netscape had not made actual profits, its co-founder, Jim Clark, urged the
                            company to go public, and its opening day was a legendary day. It was so successful that the
                            success of this IPO subsequently inspired the use of the term “Netscape moment” to describe an
                            IPO that signaled the dawn of a new industry.</p>
